# Telecom_churn Analysis using EXCEL
# Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem for telecom companies, as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. This project analyzes customer churn patterns in a telecom dataset, providing insights into factors influencing churn and suggesting data-driven strategies to reduce customer attrition.

# Objectives

* Identify key factors influencing customer churn.

* Develop interactive visualizations to track churn trends.

* Compare churn rates across different contract types and customer segments.

* Recommend strategies to improve customer retention.

# Dataset

The dataset contains customer details such as:

* Customer ID

* Contract Type (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year)

* Churn Status (Yes/No)

* Services Subscribed (DSL, Fiber Optic, Cable, etc.)

* Demographic Information (California state)

* Monthly Charges & Tenure


# Methodology

* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Removed duplicate entries and handled missing values.

* Standardized column names and formatted data types.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Used pivot tables and visualizations to analyze churn distribution.

* Examined relationships between contract type, tenure, and churn.

# Data Visualization

* Created stacked bar charts to show churn distribution by contract type.

* Used 100% stacked column charts to compare churn proportions.

* Built tree charts to show churn contribution per service type.

# Insights & Findings

* High churn rate in Month-to-Month contracts: Customers with flexible contracts tend to leave more frequently.

* Lower churn in Two-Year contracts: Customers in long-term contracts are more likely to stay.

* Fiber Optic services show the highest churn rate: Possible pricing or service quality issues.

* Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.

# Business Impact & Recommendations

* Incentivize long-term contracts: Offer discounts for yearly subscriptions.

* Improve Fiber Optic service quality: Investigate customer complaints and enhance service.

* Introduce targeted retention campaigns: Identify high-risk customers and offer personalized incentives.

* Optimize pricing strategies: Ensure competitive pricing and bundle offers to increase customer satisfaction.
